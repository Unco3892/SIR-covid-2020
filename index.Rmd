For this project, we use COVID-19 data provided by [Johns Hopkins University (updated daily)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), as well as 
data from the world bank with demographic information.
More specifically, we use daily records of total confirmed infection cases (or cumulative number of cases), total number of fatalities (or cumulative number of deaths) per country starting from `r min(covid19_data$date)` until `r max(covid19_data$date)`. 
The dataset, downloaded on `r latest_data`, contains `r format(nrow(covid19_data), big.mark = ",")` observations and `r ncol(covid19_data)` variables (`r names(covid19_data)`).

**Special credits**: This project has been developed as part of the [dsfba course](https://tvatter.github.io/dsfba_2020/) and many thanks to professor [Thibault Vatter](https://tvatter.github.io/) and his assistants for their contributions.

Furthermore, the repository for this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/Unco3892/SIR-covid-2020)
<!-- Further, we have access to world bank data with `r nrow(worldbank_data)` rows and `r ncol(worldbank_data)` columns (`r names(worldbank_data)`) with demographic information per country. -->

## A note on Epidemiological Models

Today's epidemiological models are mostly described by so called __*SIR*__-like models [see details in @Martcheva2015, pp.9--12]. In this class of models, the population is divided into three groups:

* *(__S__)usceptible* --- people, might get infected;
* *(__I__)nfectious* --- people, who carry the infection and can infect others;
* *(__R__)ecovered/(__R__)emoved* --- people, who have already recovered from the disease and got immunity.

The SIR model is a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this homework, we focus on the following *logistic* model [see @Batista2020, pp. 2; @Martcheva2015, pp. 35--36]:

\[
  \frac{dC(t)}{dt} = r \, C(t) \cdot \left[1 - \frac{C(t)}{K}\right],
\]

where $C(t)$ is the accumulated number of cases at time $t$, $r$ is the growth rate (or infection rate), and $K$ is the final size of epidemic.
Let $C_0$ be the initial number of cases: in other words, at time $t = 0$, assume that there was $C_0$ accumulated number of cases.
The solution of the *logistic* model is

\[
  C(t) = \frac{K\cdot C_0}{C_0 + (K-C_0) \, \exp(-r\,t)},
\]

which looks like a scaled *logit* model in econometrics.

## This project

Because we only have access to the confirmed cases that are reported, we use those figures as a proxy for the total number of cases, with the understanding that they almost surely underestimates the actual number of interest.
In what follows, we do a preliminary exploration of the data.
We then use the *logistic* model to analyze the spread of __COVID-19__ and try to predict the final number of accumulated confirmed cases for every country. 
More specifically, we

* start by focusing on modelling the spread in Switzerland;
* then apply the same approach to every country in the dataset.
